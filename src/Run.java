		//1: Create 4 person objects.
		//person 1: Jens, 175 cm, 69 kg.
		//person 2: Helle, 168 cm, 58 kg
		//person 3: Berit, 163 cm, 72 kg
		//person 4: Allan, 192 cm, 95 kg

		

		//2: Create a Person array with 4 positions.
		//Populate the array with the 4 person objects
		
		
		//3: Using System.out.println(), print out the names and heights and weights of the 4 people.
		// Note: It must work without modification if you changed the size of the array and the number of
		// person objects in it.
	
	
	
	
	}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	//4: Write a static method that returns the height of the specified name. The specified name
	//is sent to the method as a parameter. The Person array to search in is also sent as a parameter.
	//If the specified name does not exist in the array, the method should return 0.





	
	//5: Write a static method that returns the tallest person object in a given person array.
	//The method must take in a person array as a parameter.
	//The method should return null if the array is empty. (no people objects in it).
	
	
	
	//6: write a static method that returns the first person object in the array, that weighs more and is taller than x and y.
	//x and y should be parameters to the method and the person array to search in as well.
	//The method should return null if the array is empty. (no people objects in it).
	
	
	//7: write a method like the one above, but this time do not return only the first person object that fits the criteria.
	//Instead return all objects that fits the criteria. The method must work also if you changed the array and number of 
	//people in it.
